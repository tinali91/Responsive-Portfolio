                    My name is Tina and I currently work in marketing and communications at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I graduated in 2014. I graduated with a dual degree in Integrative Physiology and Psychology and originally started college with the intention of going to medical school. Needless to say, that didn't happen and now here I am in a coding class learning how to make things work on the interwebs.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>In my free time, I like to spend time with my dog, Winston, who is adorable. I also volunteer a lot with various nonprofit organizations including Heritage Camps for Adoptive Families (HCAF) and the Union of North American Vietnamese Student Associations (UNAVSA).</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I have a weird sense of humor and, once I get comfortable in a setting, I can be very sassy. I have a sarcastic sense of humor but I can take myself too seriously at times.And now I am just writing things to try this out and see how the text wraps once it's long enough. Is this long enough? I better keep typing just to be sure!
